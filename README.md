4. Does Location also play a role, In determining the Growth of a Startup?
5. Who plays the main role in Indian Startups Ecosystem?
6. What are the different Types of Funding for Startups?

Some of the key insights we see are 
1. The total funding for startups has remained constant the number of individual funding have decreased by around **~80%** from 2015-16 to 2018-2019. This shows that investors are betting big on well established startups and not distributing their the money over a number of startups. 
2. Swiggy , Ola , Paytm are the largest startups with maximum number of funding over the years. 
3. Consumer Internet is the leading Industry Vertical for investment. 
4. Bangalore holds it's title as the startup capital of India with over **800** funding.
